# Feedback for the presentation of the 23d of April 2020
_Date : 30.04.2020_
Note : 5.7
(6 everywere except for the time management)
## Corrections needed
Introduction was too technical, it would have been better to talk about the project itself, who it is for, what it does...

Task dependency : not realistic. Information about the tasks sequentiality was missing, and should have been clearer.

The catch-up of the delay regarding the original time table should have been justified and explained clrearly. 

## Positivs
Very professional, good team work and organisation.
